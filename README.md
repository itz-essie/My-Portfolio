# Responsive Portfolio 

## Description
Created a fully responsive portfolio by utilizing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap's CSS/Javascript Library. Portfolio consists on an "About Me" page, a "Portfolio" page to showcase my work, and a "Contact" page. Features standardized grid layout, which makes content easier to read. Also includes an adaptable, persistent navbar that will expand for larger pages, then shrinks to a collapsable format once a certain breakpoint is reached, allowing for easy navigation on any device.
